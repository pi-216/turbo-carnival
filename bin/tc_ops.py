"""tc_ops — turbo-carnival ops board: probe signals, file issues, work them.

The problem this solves: monitoring existed (cron jobs, harness logs, telemetry)
but nothing turned a detected problem into a tracked, closable work item, so the
same failures got re-diagnosed from scratch and tech debt accumulated silently.

Design: a file-based board (no server, no Jira dependency). One JSON file per
issue under ops/board/, keyed by a STABLE key, so repeated probes refresh the
same issue instead of creating duplicates. An agent-driven cron runs `probe`,
then works the open issues and closes them with a note.

  tc_ops.py probe            scan signals, file/refresh issues, print summary
  tc_ops.py list [--all]     list issues (open by default)
  tc_ops.py show KEY         full issue record
  tc_ops.py close KEY [-n]   close an issue with a resolution note
  tc_ops.py touch KEY        bump an issue (used by fixers to record progress)

Probe exits 0 always (cron-safe); prints CRITICAL/WARN counts.
